way most sites for artists are set up, the artist has to compete with everyone on the site to be seen. So, those

artists who are just getting started have a more difficult time showcasing their talent. Mysitti is designed to

make it easy for you to use, all while increasing your visibility in your city. It is set up so that when a user

lands on your cityâ€™s page, they only see artists in your city. Our format increases the exposure of even the

smallest artists, and we give you all the tools you need for free, where you have to pay on other sites. -->
